# Galanix-Test-Tasks

In this repository you can see how I did the tests for Galanix IT.

* The result of the work is in the "Solutions" folder.
* Tasks and material for work are in the "Task" folder.
* Project Task 1 and Task 2 do not require assembly.
* To open a Task 3 project in the browser, you can use the ready-made "build" in the appropriate folder, or by executing
  command
* ```npm start```, having previously installed all necessary dependencies with the help of ```npm install```.
